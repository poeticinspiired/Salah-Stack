# Salah-Stack Executive Function Coach

## Concept summary
- **Purpose:** Turn the five daily prayers into gentle, AuDHD-friendly timeboxes for planning and recovery.
- **Core framing:** “Between Dhuhr and Asr: 1 tiny task + 1 recovery block.”
- **Positioning:** Productivity + spiritual structure (not therapy; no medical claims).

## Core experience
1. **Prayer-anchored micro-plans**
   - Each window offers a *tiny task*, a *recovery block*, and a *reflection check-in*.
2. **Low-spoons mode**
   - Reduces scope to one micro-task or a 5–10 minute reset.
3. **Body-doubling prompts**
   - Optional “focus buddy” cues (e.g., “invite a friend / join a group co-work”).
4. **Automatic restart plans**
   - If a block is missed, the app offers a “restart” script and rolls the plan forward without punishment.

## Personalization & behavior design
- **Adaptive onboarding quiz** to tune energy levels, capacity, and preferred task sizes.
- **Streaks without shame** using “return points” instead of streak breaks.
- **Daily check-ins** after each prayer window to reinforce gentle habit loops.

## Monetization
- **$9–$15/month subscription** for coaching, routines, reminders, and templates.
- **$39–$99 one-time “Ramadan Reset Pack.”**
- **Team/masjid licensing** for youth groups and community programs.

## Optimization levers
- **Personalization depth** (quiz → adaptive scheduling).
- **Soft accountability** (body-doubling prompts, optional reminders).
- **Re-entry UX** (restart scripts, reduced friction after missed windows).

## Compliance notes
- Avoid medical claims.
- Frame as **productivity + spiritual structure**, not therapy.
